# Music Recommendation Model

![Music Recommendation Model Demo]

## Overview

Welcome to the Music Recommendation Model project! This repository contains the code and resources for a powerful music recommendation system. Leveraging the WSDM - KKBox's Music Recommendation Challenge dataset, we've merged and processed the data to provide precise music recommendations. The model uses the Surprise library and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for accurate predictions. Additionally, it recommends the top 10 songs tailored to user preferences.
